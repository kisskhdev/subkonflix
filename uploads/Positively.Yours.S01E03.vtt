[Production guidelines were followed

00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:44.438
So,

00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:46.338
[Episode 3]
let's meet at least three times a week.

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:47.338
What?

00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:50.338
Love. Let's give it a try properly.

00:00:51.172 --> 00:00:54.438
Are you always this clingy?

00:00:54.438 --> 00:00:56.538
What did you say?

00:00:56.538 --> 00:00:59.105
I have absolutely no intention
of marrying or dating you.

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:02.505
Not at all.

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:03.872
So,

00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:06.438
it seems you've misunderstood me.

00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:07.938
I said I'd help you...

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:12.238
So I'm telling you I don't need your help.

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.805
- Not even a little?
- Not even a little.

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:16.672
Then what about that night?

00:01:17.872 --> 00:01:20.838
Let's just say we both had fun.

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:23.305
Let's be cool about it.

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:38.938
Keep your voice down. People are staring.

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.272
Unbelievable.

00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:43.372
This is ridiculous.

00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:44.605
She doesn't need any help?

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:45.638
'Be cool about it'?

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.738
I'll handle it, so just rest.

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:58.572
Is she giving up everything
and just going to Germany like this?

00:01:59.638 --> 00:02:01.372
Seriously...

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:11.138
I even turned a blind eye to her
being with another man.

00:02:11.138 --> 00:02:13.372
You know what? Fine.
This is for the best anyway.

00:02:13.372 --> 00:02:15.538
Let's just go our separate ways.

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:20.105
What? Where'd he go?

00:02:21.072 --> 00:02:22.372
Secretary Go.

00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:24.772
Sec... huh?

00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:27.738
Where'd he go?

00:02:32.138 --> 00:02:34.005
He actually said that? The father?

00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:35.238
I told you.

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.072
He's from a completely different world.

00:02:37.072 --> 00:02:38.472
I have to face him at work every day.

00:02:38.472 --> 00:02:40.672
He's the president. And I'm just an employee.

00:02:40.672 --> 00:02:43.705
Would someone like him suddenly
claim the baby is his? Does that make sense?

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.472
Ugh, your stubbornness is unreal.

00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:47.672
Would a guy propose marriage

00:02:47.672 --> 00:02:50.672
to a woman he doesn't even care about?

00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:52.105
Do you think he said that
because he likes me?

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.272
Oh my, then why?

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:54.605
Responsibility.

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:56.605
It's obviously out of responsibility.

00:02:56.605 --> 00:03:01.372
I never planned on marrying anyway,
leaving that option only raises expectations.

00:03:03.072 --> 00:03:05.272
Ms. Hui Won.

00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:08.138
Hold on, I'll call you back later.

00:03:09.972 --> 00:03:11.038
What brings you here?

00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:12.138
I was just passing by.

00:03:12.138 --> 00:03:14.205
Have you eaten?

00:03:28.638 --> 00:03:32.105
Here are the resume and documents
of Jang Hui Won that you requested.

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:34.205
[Manager Jang Hui Won]
This baby wasn't planned.

00:03:34.205 --> 00:03:36.005
At the most crucial moment,

00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:39.938
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
has arrived alongside this new life.

00:03:39.938 --> 00:03:41.738
Are you after the money?

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:46.672
Or are you trying to trap a man
to climb the social ladder?

00:03:46.672 --> 00:03:48.472
I'll pay today.

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:51.005
Order anything you want.

00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:52.838
I asked you out, so I'll pay.

00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:55.572
No, you treated me to meat last time.

00:03:55.572 --> 00:03:59.338
Actually, I got paid today.

00:04:11.538 --> 00:04:14.205
Have you made your choice?

00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:21.172
I guess my own life is
still more important to me.

00:04:23.772 --> 00:04:25.038
Life has taught me

00:04:25.038 --> 00:04:27.138
that a child who could be a blessing to some

00:04:27.138 --> 00:04:29.305
can become a burden to others.

00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:32.538
You can have a child again
when you are ready.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.272
Again?

00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:40.172
What does the father say?
He's not against it?

00:04:41.238 --> 00:04:43.338
He doesn't know yet.

00:04:43.338 --> 00:04:46.305
It's my decision alone.

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:49.572
Dragging it out only harms the woman's body.

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:53.538
What can men even do?
They can't carry the baby for us.

00:04:57.305 --> 00:04:59.072
The food's getting cold.

00:05:02.638 --> 00:05:04.645
[Mom]

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:19.572
She came alone and seemed a bit drunk.

00:05:19.572 --> 00:05:21.305
I'm sorry.

00:05:23.472 --> 00:05:25.938
Get up, I'll take you home.

00:05:26.738 --> 00:05:28.838
I can go alone.

00:05:31.172 --> 00:05:32.638
Stop being so stubborn.

00:05:32.638 --> 00:05:34.638
How bad must it be if you called me?

00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:39.972
I've managed just fine on my own.

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:41.738
What are you saying?

00:05:45.705 --> 00:05:47.772
Goodbye.

00:05:55.138 --> 00:05:56.421
I'll pay for this...

00:06:02.938 --> 00:06:04.672
Thank you for your hard work.

00:06:05.872 --> 00:06:07.605
Mom!

00:06:10.238 --> 00:06:12.472
Why do you keep saying
you'll do everything alone?

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:13.605
What's wrong with you?

00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:14.972
You acting like this makes me uncomfortable.

00:06:14.972 --> 00:06:16.472
Am I a stranger to you?

00:06:16.472 --> 00:06:19.438
If you don't rely on me,
who will you rely on?

00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:21.672
That's your problem, Mom.

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:23.138
You never let anyone close,

00:06:23.138 --> 00:06:25.872
and it just drives everyone around you crazy.

00:06:25.872 --> 00:06:27.605
So,

00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:32.005
that's why your dad cheated?

00:06:32.005 --> 00:06:33.172
Is that it?

00:06:33.172 --> 00:06:34.405
Why are you twisting my words?

00:06:34.405 --> 00:06:36.172
You mean that, right?

00:06:36.172 --> 00:06:38.338
You're blaming me now, aren't you?

00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:41.305
Basically, you're saying
it's all my own fault!

00:06:41.305 --> 00:06:42.538
Yeah.

00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:44.672
I never even asked for your devotion.

00:06:44.672 --> 00:06:48.305
All I wanted was a little praise or a smile.

00:06:48.305 --> 00:06:50.538
How can you only think
about yourself until the very end?

00:06:50.538 --> 00:06:52.038
If I were you,

00:06:52.038 --> 00:06:55.438
I would never live like you, understand?

00:07:01.872 --> 00:07:04.405
You should've been on my side.

00:07:04.405 --> 00:07:06.872
Even if everyone else turns their backs,

00:07:06.872 --> 00:07:09.605
you should have been with me!

00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:18.338
You bad girl.

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:01.772
Hui Won, drink this.

00:08:05.905 --> 00:08:07.305
She's so selfish.

00:08:07.305 --> 00:08:09.372
She can't possibly be that indifferent.

00:08:09.372 --> 00:08:10.605
She was like that earlier too.

00:08:10.605 --> 00:08:14.238
She doesn't care at all
that her daughter is pregnant.

00:08:16.405 --> 00:08:19.338
But what annoys me more is

00:08:19.338 --> 00:08:21.005
that I might become like Mom.

00:08:21.005 --> 00:08:25.672
I might end up regretting
things just like she said.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:26.905
You...

00:08:26.905 --> 00:08:27.905
Hey, you blockhead!

00:08:27.905 --> 00:08:30.172
Why are you worrying about that?

00:08:30.172 --> 00:08:32.605
Just because you made the same decision
doesn't mean it'll be the same.

00:08:32.605 --> 00:08:34.738
You're not your mom.

00:08:34.738 --> 00:08:37.972
Even if you have a baby,
you can live well. So why not?

00:08:37.972 --> 00:08:39.472
Just do what you want.

00:08:39.472 --> 00:08:42.405
If someone throws stones,
I'll take the blow for you.

00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:47.172
If you're having the baby,
I'll help raise it.

00:08:47.172 --> 00:08:51.272
So go on the path you truly want. Okay?

00:08:55.138 --> 00:08:56.938
Okay.

00:08:56.938 --> 00:08:58.805
Thank you.

00:09:12.972 --> 00:09:14.238
What will you do now?

00:09:14.238 --> 00:09:15.438
You're not actually going
to keep it, are you?

00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:17.272
Are you even thinking
about marrying that guy?

00:09:17.272 --> 00:09:20.138
No, it's not like that.

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:33.638
Hey, aren't you going home?

00:09:33.638 --> 00:09:35.105
Staying here?

00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:37.172
Anyway, I'm your secretary.

00:09:37.172 --> 00:09:41.205
My boss is pulling that stony face now.
How could I even go home?

00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:42.305
What is it?

00:09:42.305 --> 00:09:45.238
What's the problem? Tell me.

00:09:46.572 --> 00:09:49.838
Have you ever fought with your mom?

00:09:49.838 --> 00:09:53.272
If anyone in Korea hasn't fought
with their mom, tell them to step forward.

00:09:53.272 --> 00:09:55.238
If there's anyone, I'll applaud them all day.

00:09:55.238 --> 00:09:56.738
I got scolded a lot by Mom.

00:09:56.738 --> 00:09:59.138
Got punished for talking back,
even beaten with a stick.

00:09:59.138 --> 00:10:01.572
Kicked out in freezing winter
wearing just long johns.

00:10:01.572 --> 00:10:03.272
No, not that.

00:10:03.272 --> 00:10:05.238
I mean fights where you hurt each other.

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:07.338
Don't tell me you fought with your mother?

00:10:07.338 --> 00:10:11.305
No, it's not that. I'm just curious.

00:10:11.305 --> 00:10:13.738
Fought and hurt each other?

00:10:15.005 --> 00:10:16.772
- I have.
- How was it?

00:10:16.772 --> 00:10:20.672
It hurt, both me and Mom.

00:10:20.672 --> 00:10:24.972
We dug at each other
with sharp words, of course it hurt.

00:10:24.972 --> 00:10:28.105
But you know those wounds can heal, right?

00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:33.472
Clean the wound,
put a bandage, wait a few days,

00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:35.805
and new skin grows back.

00:10:35.805 --> 00:10:37.372
So,

00:10:37.372 --> 00:10:40.205
that's why what comes after
the wound is important.

00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:42.738
What if new skin doesn't grow in days?

00:10:42.738 --> 00:10:46.905
Then you wait patiently until it heals.

00:10:46.905 --> 00:10:49.705
If you fought with your mom, make up fast.

00:10:49.705 --> 00:10:52.172
How old are you now,
still fighting with your mom?

00:10:52.172 --> 00:10:54.438
That's not what I...

00:10:56.038 --> 00:10:59.505
Anyway, thanks.

00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:01.205
Thanks... what? I didn't catch that.

00:11:01.205 --> 00:11:02.905
Thanks... what?

00:11:04.972 --> 00:11:06.938
Secretary Go, go home now.

00:11:06.938 --> 00:11:08.872
You're driving me crazy.

00:11:08.872 --> 00:11:10.981
Turn off all the lights when you leave.

00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:13.772
I'm really hurt.

00:11:13.772 --> 00:11:15.405
I'm hurt!

00:11:15.405 --> 00:11:16.672
Oh, please.

00:11:16.672 --> 00:11:18.805
[Hui Won]

00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:23.653
[Hui Won]

00:11:26.738 --> 00:11:28.438
Hey, how did you...

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:31.172
A thirsty person digs a well.

00:11:31.172 --> 00:11:34.905
Though I confess and get rejected,
we can't be friends?

00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:36.005
No.

00:11:36.005 --> 00:11:38.738
It's not that I didn't try to contact you...

00:11:38.738 --> 00:11:40.138
Oh, whatever.

00:11:40.138 --> 00:11:43.272
We've kissed. What kind of friends is that?

00:11:43.272 --> 00:11:45.572
I want to stay

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:49.205
as someone who can
cross the line with you anytime.

00:11:49.205 --> 00:11:50.472
This is making me uncomfortable.

00:11:50.472 --> 00:11:51.672
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:11:51.672 --> 00:11:53.272
- Or someone you like?
- Huh?

00:11:53.272 --> 00:11:55.205
Tell me if you find someone.

00:11:55.205 --> 00:11:56.672
So I can try harder.

00:11:56.672 --> 00:11:57.872
Hey, Hwang Mi Ran.

00:11:57.872 --> 00:11:58.872
This is frustrating.

00:11:58.872 --> 00:12:00.138
Why hold back your feelings?

00:12:00.138 --> 00:12:03.572
If you overthink, you'll miss good people.

00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:09.438
Gonna miss me?

00:12:12.538 --> 00:12:15.272
Tell the president to come out!

00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:19.472
You gave alcohol to a breastfeeding woman?
Are you insane?

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.972
What are you doing?

00:12:20.972 --> 00:12:24.538
Call the president here. Get him now!

00:12:24.538 --> 00:12:26.738
- Let go!
- You can't do this here.

00:12:26.738 --> 00:12:27.938
- Let me go!
- Come out!

00:12:27.938 --> 00:12:29.672
I won't just stay still.

00:12:29.672 --> 00:12:31.572
- I'll sue!
- Seems like there was chaos this morning

00:12:31.572 --> 00:12:33.105
demanding the president come out.

00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:34.645
I heard he ramped up beer shipments

00:12:34.645 --> 00:12:37.005
and gave them away for free
at postpartum care centers.

00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:39.105
Doesn't that smell fishy?

00:12:39.105 --> 00:12:40.138
See?

00:12:40.138 --> 00:12:42.272
Then and now, he does whatever he wants.

00:12:42.272 --> 00:12:46.672
Kang Du Jun, always stirring up trouble,
becomes the president of Taehan Liquor?

00:12:46.672 --> 00:12:48.105
It's the Chairman's order.

00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:50.205
We'll just have to wait and see.

00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:54.072
Whether he arbitrarily increased shipments
or gave things away for free,

00:12:54.072 --> 00:12:55.605
none of that matters.

00:12:55.605 --> 00:13:00.472
What matters is giving the woman alcohol.
We just need to frame it.

00:13:00.472 --> 00:13:02.272
[Han Jeong Eum]
A woman hidden at the care center.

00:13:02.272 --> 00:13:04.072
Kang Du Jun's illegitimate child.

00:13:04.072 --> 00:13:05.105
Plenty of bait, right?

00:13:05.105 --> 00:13:07.772
Readers will judge
based on the articles anyway.

00:13:07.772 --> 00:13:09.872
Ahem.

00:13:17.038 --> 00:13:20.138
I was already looking for the right timing.

00:13:20.138 --> 00:13:22.772
There's no such thing as the 'right timing.'

00:13:22.772 --> 00:13:25.205
You make your own timing.

00:13:25.205 --> 00:13:27.138
You're good at that, Uncle.

00:13:27.138 --> 00:13:29.638
Just like 15 years ago.

00:13:29.638 --> 00:13:34.405
But if I get caught by your brother...

00:13:35.672 --> 00:13:37.538
I'll help you out.

00:13:37.538 --> 00:13:41.905
It seems like it's time to take over
Taehan Group.

00:13:43.638 --> 00:13:46.105
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:13:46.105 --> 00:13:50.405
If I stay put, the position
will go to Se Hyeon next.

00:13:50.405 --> 00:13:52.605
Well,

00:13:52.605 --> 00:13:57.638
my life feels too precious

00:13:57.638 --> 00:13:59.772
to be satisfied with just that.

00:14:07.872 --> 00:14:10.772
I never even asked for your devotion.

00:14:10.772 --> 00:14:13.338
All I wanted was a little praise or a smile.

00:14:13.338 --> 00:14:15.072
How can you only think
about yourself until the very end?

00:14:15.072 --> 00:14:16.572
If I were you,

00:14:16.572 --> 00:14:19.972
I would never live like you, understand?

00:14:24.605 --> 00:14:29.138
I told you to cut back on the foundation work
and unprofitable ventures.

00:14:29.138 --> 00:14:31.372
And what's with the postpartum care center?

00:14:31.372 --> 00:14:33.138
And the shelter for single mothers?

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:37.605
It sounds like you think I'm so powerless
to handle even charitable and volunteer work.

00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:39.138
Charity itself isn't the issue,

00:14:39.138 --> 00:14:40.905
but depending on the organization,

00:14:40.905 --> 00:14:44.138
it could easily become scandal fodder.

00:14:44.138 --> 00:14:48.472
I've heard Moo Young's been
doing rounds with journalists lately.

00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:49.738
Don't worry.

00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:52.805
I won't just take it
lying down like last time.

00:14:52.805 --> 00:14:54.838
Good.

00:14:54.838 --> 00:14:57.705
No issues with your sister-in-law lately?

00:14:57.705 --> 00:14:59.872
Why do you ask?

00:15:00.972 --> 00:15:02.372
After what happened to your brother,

00:15:02.372 --> 00:15:05.138
I wondered if she still holds a grudge.

00:15:06.738 --> 00:15:08.605
Ah, enough about that.

00:15:08.605 --> 00:15:12.305
Your mother seems to be
stirring up something again?

00:15:12.305 --> 00:15:14.072
Mother?

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.105
Madam.

00:15:25.472 --> 00:15:27.538
Here are the materials
from Grace in Cheongdam.

00:15:27.538 --> 00:15:30.638
As requested, they've selected
well-regarded candidates

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:31.938
from prominent families.

00:15:31.938 --> 00:15:33.072
Oh, really?

00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:34.805
Let me see.

00:15:38.789 --> 00:15:44.338
Politician's child,
hospital director's daughter...

00:15:44.338 --> 00:15:47.638
Their faces...

00:15:47.638 --> 00:15:49.905
I only need one thing, character!

00:15:49.905 --> 00:15:53.372
What? Mr. Lee? Has that punk lost his mind?

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:54.405
Tell him to get out.

00:15:54.405 --> 00:15:57.496
Show him what happens
when he stabs me in the back.

00:15:57.496 --> 00:15:58.605
Jeez.

00:15:58.605 --> 00:16:02.872
If my second daughter-in-law is like her,
I won't live out my days peacefully.

00:16:03.705 --> 00:16:07.338
Where is the gentle, polite woman

00:16:07.338 --> 00:16:11.305
who can comfort our Du Jun?

00:16:16.172 --> 00:16:18.905
What, you have something to say?

00:16:19.672 --> 00:16:21.305
Vice Chairman Kang Moo Young

00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:23.072
is famously two-faced.

00:16:23.072 --> 00:16:25.872
I was wondering if working with him is okay.

00:16:25.872 --> 00:16:27.772
Have you ever grown plants?

00:16:27.772 --> 00:16:28.772
Pardon?

00:16:28.772 --> 00:16:31.538
You know about pruning
when growing plants, right?

00:16:31.538 --> 00:16:32.805
Ah, yes.

00:16:32.805 --> 00:16:36.772
You don't just cut off the dead branches.
You also cut healthy ones.

00:16:36.772 --> 00:16:38.672
Why do you think that is?

00:16:38.672 --> 00:16:41.272
Because they steal too many nutrients?

00:16:42.005 --> 00:16:45.105
At first, they're needed
to grow together vigorously,

00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:49.093
but no matter how strong,
if they steal too many nutrients,

00:16:49.093 --> 00:16:51.172
they just become obstacles.

00:16:51.172 --> 00:16:53.605
That's when you prune them.

00:16:53.605 --> 00:16:58.472
I've already calculated
the timing for the cuts.

00:17:05.305 --> 00:17:07.338
Since it's our first ale beer in a long time,

00:17:07.338 --> 00:17:11.205
let's lower the IBU level more to balance
the bitterness as much as possible.

00:17:11.205 --> 00:17:12.438
Yes, understood.

00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:13.672
And for the marketing plan,

00:17:13.672 --> 00:17:17.472
let's also target new channels
like trendy bars or emotional pubs.

00:17:17.472 --> 00:17:21.972
Yes, I'll review it according to
your direction and get back to you.

00:17:22.705 --> 00:17:24.438
President.

00:17:26.172 --> 00:17:28.005

This is way too similar, isn't it?

00:17:50.572 --> 00:17:52.438
Did you properly conduct the market research?

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:53.772
Yes, of course.

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:57.638
We've been closely tracking competitors
and ensuring strict confidentiality

00:17:57.638 --> 00:18:00.472
from before planning
the new product up to its launch.

00:18:00.472 --> 00:18:03.005
So is there any chance the idea was leaked?

00:18:03.005 --> 00:18:04.272
That's absurd, sir.

00:18:04.272 --> 00:18:06.005
Actually, it's not entirely impossible.

00:18:06.005 --> 00:18:07.738
They released it way earlier than we did.

00:18:07.738 --> 00:18:10.105
There's no way they plagiarized us.

00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:12.272
This isn't about assigning blame.

00:18:12.272 --> 00:18:13.838
We need to verify the facts.

00:18:13.838 --> 00:18:15.005
Who's in charge of this?

00:18:15.005 --> 00:18:19.738
Come to think of it, the manager for this
is the one chosen for Germany, right?

00:18:19.738 --> 00:18:22.038
Is it Manager Jang Hui Won?

00:18:22.672 --> 00:18:24.738
Before the Germany results were announced,

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:28.038
if launching this new product
was counted as bonus points,

00:18:28.038 --> 00:18:31.772
wouldn't that make the plagiarism claim
highly plausible?

00:18:31.772 --> 00:18:33.505
Now...

00:18:39.038 --> 00:18:40.172
That's ridiculous.

00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:43.305
How could both the concept
and recipe overlap by coincidence?

00:18:43.305 --> 00:18:46.072
We've been working overtime
for months on this launch.

00:18:46.072 --> 00:18:49.272
Even if I copied it, I'd surely
get caught, so why would I do it?

00:18:49.272 --> 00:18:51.638
- Why would I?
- Bonus points.

00:18:52.538 --> 00:18:54.472
- Bonus points?
- Really?

00:18:54.472 --> 00:18:56.538
- No...
- No way.

00:18:56.538 --> 00:18:58.238
You wanted to study in Germany, right?

00:18:58.238 --> 00:19:00.771
Didn't you plagiarize for bonus points?

00:19:00.771 --> 00:19:01.772
Team Leader.

00:19:01.772 --> 00:19:03.772
Rumors are spreading that
the scores from this new product

00:19:03.772 --> 00:19:07.005
are included in your
Germany study application.

00:19:07.005 --> 00:19:10.138
Did you think you could just
wrap it up and dash off to Germany?

00:19:10.138 --> 00:19:11.338
Well, Team Leader.

00:19:11.338 --> 00:19:12.472
You're being too harsh.

00:19:12.472 --> 00:19:14.472
True, no matter how much she wanted Germany,

00:19:14.472 --> 00:19:16.005
I doubt the manager would go that far.

00:19:16.005 --> 00:19:17.072
Why not?

00:19:17.072 --> 00:19:19.205
Hearing it now, I think it's possible.

00:19:19.205 --> 00:19:20.605
Why are you siding against her too,
Assistant Manager?

00:19:20.605 --> 00:19:21.838
Think carefully, all of you.

00:19:21.838 --> 00:19:24.338
Because of her, our whole team
is about to take the fall.

00:19:24.338 --> 00:19:28.405
Because of you, our whole team
is going to be investigated, okay?

00:19:35.172 --> 00:19:37.472
Ah, I shouldn't have asked.

00:19:37.472 --> 00:19:40.338
She's not getting punished
on my account, right?

00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:52.272
- Jeez.
- Oh, my.

00:19:52.272 --> 00:19:54.672
- You scared me!
- You startled me.

00:19:54.672 --> 00:19:55.938
What is it?

00:19:55.938 --> 00:19:58.005
Where are you heading?

00:19:58.005 --> 00:19:59.805
No, nowhere.

00:19:59.805 --> 00:20:02.672
Then what brings you here, Ms. Jang Hui Won?

00:20:03.338 --> 00:20:05.372
I came to see you, President.

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.905
Then come on in.

00:20:12.889 --> 00:20:14.309
Sit.

00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:18.172
Do you need any help from me?

00:20:18.172 --> 00:20:20.372
No.

00:20:20.372 --> 00:20:22.572
I didn't copy it.

00:20:24.472 --> 00:20:26.772
Are you here to explain yourself now?

00:20:26.772 --> 00:20:30.638
Explanations won't help now.
We need to manage the situation.

00:20:30.638 --> 00:20:32.905
Then,

00:20:32.905 --> 00:20:34.072
I'll take responsibility.

00:20:34.072 --> 00:20:35.605
Responsibility? How?

00:20:35.605 --> 00:20:37.538
I'll resolve this quickly.

00:20:37.538 --> 00:20:41.838
But please just punish me alone.

00:20:41.838 --> 00:20:44.672
Our team did nothing wrong.

00:20:46.472 --> 00:20:48.005
Ms. Jang Hui Won.

00:20:48.005 --> 00:20:50.438
Who do you think you are?

00:20:50.438 --> 00:20:54.205
Since you handle everything alone,
you can clean up this mess alone too?

00:20:54.205 --> 00:20:55.672
- That's not what I...
- Since we're short on time,

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:58.205
report to me in real-time as soon as
the new concept comes out.

00:20:58.205 --> 00:21:00.605
Bring it over as soon as it's ready.

00:21:00.605 --> 00:21:01.638
In person?

00:21:01.638 --> 00:21:04.772
Why? Don't trust yourself?

Can you even eat in this situation?
I haven't even eaten yet.

Actually, the more critical the situation,
the more you need to eat properly.

00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:46.772
By the way, Manager Jang must be
busy fixing this. I wonder if she's eaten.

Don't do it half-heartedly.

It's too identical to be a coincidence.

the surface in the same way.

00:33:26.138 --> 00:33:28.705
Why? What on earth is the reason?

00:33:28.705 --> 00:33:32.105
Explain to me, even briefly,
what's wrong and how.

00:33:32.105 --> 00:33:33.672
The reason...

00:33:33.672 --> 00:33:36.805
Then shall we start
with the first concept you proposed?

00:33:36.805 --> 00:33:41.205
Do you know why Taehan Liquor
abandoned ale production ten years ago?

00:33:41.205 --> 00:33:44.838
Because sales didn't meet expectations.

00:33:44.838 --> 00:33:48.205
Yes, exactly. We failed to achieve
the expected results.

00:33:48.205 --> 00:33:51.205
So we boldly cut our losses
and decided to invest in what we do better.

00:33:51.205 --> 00:33:53.005
But now, after ten years,

00:33:53.005 --> 00:33:57.072
when we're barely meeting expectations
with a fresh concept for this ale challenge,

00:33:57.072 --> 00:34:00.272
do you really think recycling a recipe
used elsewhere will work?

00:34:00.272 --> 00:34:01.838
- That's...
- The second concept.

00:34:01.838 --> 00:34:05.372
Despite ale's strengths,
emphasizing lager's refreshment

00:34:05.372 --> 00:34:07.872
doesn't seem to suit
the top-fermentation method.

00:34:07.872 --> 00:34:09.938
- Third...
- I get it.

00:34:09.938 --> 00:34:13.338
So you're saying there were
reasons behind everything.

00:34:13.972 --> 00:34:17.138
From the start, Manager Jang,
your approach was wrong.

00:34:17.138 --> 00:34:18.772
Just because you're the manager in charge,

00:34:18.772 --> 00:34:21.072
you think you alone can solve
this huge project's problems?

00:34:21.072 --> 00:34:24.905
Don't you think that approach is reckless
and irresponsible from the get-go?

00:34:24.905 --> 00:34:26.738
Since it's come up,

00:34:26.738 --> 00:34:30.105
why sacrifice your health
and stake your life on results?

00:34:30.105 --> 00:34:32.005
You've already received ample incentives,

00:34:32.005 --> 00:34:33.238
and your study program
in Germany is confirmed.

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:34.672
- Why are you bringing that up...
- The company clearly has

00:34:34.672 --> 00:34:36.101
a hierarchy and system.

00:34:36.101 --> 00:34:38.838
But why didn't you ask me for help?

00:34:38.838 --> 00:34:40.538
Pardon?

00:34:54.472 --> 00:34:57.638
Why didn't you ask me for help!

00:34:57.638 --> 00:34:59.072
Don't laugh.

00:34:59.072 --> 00:35:00.938
So all of this was just to get her attention.

00:35:00.938 --> 00:35:02.038
- It's not!
- It is!

00:35:02.038 --> 00:35:05.238
I said no! You weird-looking guy.

00:35:06.538 --> 00:35:09.405
Why do I look weird?

00:35:10.072 --> 00:35:11.805
Don't laugh.

00:35:13.138 --> 00:35:14.838
Yes.

00:35:16.372 --> 00:35:18.138
Did you find something?

00:35:20.538 --> 00:35:23.772
Focus on doing it right, not fast.

00:35:29.005 --> 00:35:33.672
Can the Audit Team access
employees' internal messenger logs?

00:35:33.672 --> 00:35:34.905
No, just one person.

00:35:34.905 --> 00:35:37.205
I only need to check one person's.

00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:43.505
About the materials you requested
over the phone last time.

00:35:43.505 --> 00:35:47.005
It's still just suspicion, so I wasn't sure
whether to tell you.

00:35:47.005 --> 00:35:48.357
Here...

00:35:50.172 --> 00:35:52.205
Uh, wait a minute, here.

00:35:54.105 --> 00:35:56.438
Let me talk to Team Leader Baek.

00:35:56.438 --> 00:35:57.438
Will he actually keep his promises?

00:35:57.438 --> 00:35:58.738
It's a bit hard to do it immediately,

00:35:58.738 --> 00:36:00.772
but he said he'd call after some time.

00:36:00.772 --> 00:36:03.805
Let's discuss the details over the phone.

00:36:03.805 --> 00:36:07.472
Is there any Team Leader Baek in our company?

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:15.238
Hello.

00:36:15.238 --> 00:36:17.338
Oh, welcome.

00:36:17.338 --> 00:36:18.372
What would you like to have?

00:36:18.372 --> 00:36:19.538
- What should we eat?
- What?

00:36:19.538 --> 00:36:21.105
Has he been sulking
about that this whole time?

00:36:21.105 --> 00:36:23.438
I don't know. Honestly, I just don't get it.

00:36:23.438 --> 00:36:26.172
I mean, even so, making a pregnant woman
go through that is harsh.

00:36:26.172 --> 00:36:30.572
But his reasons were all valid though.

00:36:30.572 --> 00:36:34.205
Can't the manager solve
some things on their own?

00:36:34.205 --> 00:36:37.472
I just don't want to inconvenience
the team since it's my responsibility.

00:36:37.472 --> 00:36:39.672
That's why I did it.

00:36:39.672 --> 00:36:41.672
I know. I know very well.

00:36:41.672 --> 00:36:43.338
Don't stress yourself out
over that for no reason.

00:36:43.338 --> 00:36:44.572
It's not good for the baby.

00:36:44.572 --> 00:36:46.438
Breathe. Breathe.

00:36:49.638 --> 00:36:51.538
Yeah, breathe.

00:37:22.838 --> 00:37:24.972
What is it?

00:37:24.972 --> 00:37:26.038
So you're off work now?

00:37:26.038 --> 00:37:28.172
What, did you come to apologize?

00:37:28.172 --> 00:37:30.338
Or did you come to hear an apology?

00:37:30.338 --> 00:37:34.172
After thinking about it,
it wasn't completely unreasonable.

00:37:34.172 --> 00:37:36.972
Switching the aroma hops
to domestically grown hops.

00:37:36.972 --> 00:37:39.772
It might actually be the best solution
for our current situation...

00:37:39.772 --> 00:37:42.738
Did you come all the way
here just to say that?

00:37:44.905 --> 00:37:46.072
No, actually, the audit team...

00:37:46.072 --> 00:37:48.038
It's fine. You don't need to sugarcoat it.

00:37:48.038 --> 00:37:50.605
It's true that my proposal wasn't great.

00:37:50.605 --> 00:37:52.238
No, that's not really it...

00:37:52.238 --> 00:37:53.272
I admit it.

00:37:53.272 --> 00:37:55.672
I was desperate and only
thinking about fixing things.

00:37:55.672 --> 00:37:57.972
I ignored responsibility and hierarchy,
and took it all upon myself.

00:37:57.972 --> 00:37:58.972
But,

00:37:58.972 --> 00:38:00.038
the choices I made

00:38:00.038 --> 00:38:02.505
might seem irresponsible to you, President,

00:38:02.505 --> 00:38:04.172
but they were choices
made for specific reasons.

00:38:04.172 --> 00:38:06.805
They weren't decisions I made lightly at all.

00:38:06.805 --> 00:38:08.772
So...

00:38:08.772 --> 00:38:10.505
I mean...

00:38:12.672 --> 00:38:14.341
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

00:38:14.341 --> 00:38:15.805
It's...

00:38:15.805 --> 00:38:16.805
- My belly...
- Belly?

00:38:16.805 --> 00:38:19.238
- What's wrong with it? Huh?
- Ow!

00:38:24.205 --> 00:38:25.738
The baby...

00:38:25.738 --> 00:38:27.272
Nothing's wrong with the baby, right?

00:38:27.272 --> 00:38:29.405
That shouldn't be the case,
so relax and get examined.

00:38:29.405 --> 00:38:31.238
I'll handle things here, so don't worry.

00:38:31.238 --> 00:38:33.172
Excuse me.

00:38:33.172 --> 00:38:34.805
Guardian for Jang Hui Won?

00:38:34.805 --> 00:38:35.838
Yes.

00:38:35.838 --> 00:38:38.005
Please fill out this form.

00:38:46.105 --> 00:38:48.938
It seems the mother has been
under a lot of stress.

00:38:48.938 --> 00:38:53.472
The risk of miscarriage is high
in early pregnancy, so be extra careful.

00:38:54.172 --> 00:38:55.938
Are you here to explain yourself now?

00:38:55.938 --> 00:38:57.672
Explanations won't help now.

00:38:57.672 --> 00:38:58.738
We need to manage the situation.

00:38:58.738 --> 00:39:00.372
Just because you're the manager in charge,

00:39:00.372 --> 00:39:02.772
you think you alone can solve
this huge project's problems?

00:39:02.772 --> 00:39:06.572
Don't you think that approach is reckless
and irresponsible from the get-go?

00:39:20.372 --> 00:39:21.637
[Min Uk]

00:39:29.072 --> 00:39:31.805
Yeah, what happened? Did everything go well?

00:39:31.805 --> 00:39:33.505
Hello?

00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:36.572
Isn't this Jang Hui Won's phone?

00:39:36.572 --> 00:39:39.472
- Who are you?
- And who are you?

00:39:40.338 --> 00:39:42.205
- Are you that male friend?
- Do you know me?

00:39:42.205 --> 00:39:44.338
I'm the person responsible for Jang Hui Won.

00:39:44.338 --> 00:39:45.765
Ah, yes.

00:39:45.765 --> 00:39:49.072
Since Hui Won's next to you,
can I talk to her?

00:39:49.072 --> 00:39:51.938
- It's work.
- Hui Won is sleeping right now.

00:39:51.938 --> 00:39:53.438
It's barely 8 PM.

00:39:53.438 --> 00:39:56.638
Isn't it rude to call a friend
with a boyfriend at 8 o'clock at night?

00:39:56.638 --> 00:40:00.472
No matter how tired she is,
she doesn't sleep at 8 PM.

00:40:00.472 --> 00:40:02.938
Why are you interfering
with her sleeping schedule?

00:40:02.938 --> 00:40:04.172
What?

00:40:04.172 --> 00:40:05.538
No, what I meant was...

00:40:05.538 --> 00:40:08.872
From now on, please refrain
from calling Ms. Jang Hui Won

00:40:08.872 --> 00:40:09.972
for personal matters after 7 PM.

00:40:09.972 --> 00:40:12.038
And if you have business,
text instead of calling.

00:40:12.038 --> 00:40:13.138
If there's nothing else, I'll hang up.

00:40:13.138 --> 00:40:15.905
- That's not it, hello?
- What are you doing there?

00:40:17.505 --> 00:40:18.505
You're awake.

00:40:18.505 --> 00:40:20.272
How are you feeling?

00:40:21.205 --> 00:40:23.005
How's the baby?

00:40:24.372 --> 00:40:27.005
Ah, well...

00:40:31.472 --> 00:40:36.472
As you can see, it's now
about the size of a gummy bear.

00:40:37.872 --> 00:40:40.238
This is the yolk sac.

00:40:40.238 --> 00:40:41.905
And over here is the head.

00:40:41.905 --> 00:40:44.205
- See it?
- Yes.

00:40:44.205 --> 00:40:47.038
Shall we listen to the heartbeat?

00:40:50.572 --> 00:40:52.438
The ultrasound shows it's healthy,

00:40:52.438 --> 00:40:54.972
but because of the stomach cramps
and spotting this time,

00:40:54.972 --> 00:40:57.105
I'll give you a shot to prevent miscarriage.

00:40:57.105 --> 00:41:00.538
Please get absolute rest
for the next few days.

00:41:00.538 --> 00:41:02.238
Okay.

00:41:55.072 --> 00:41:58.338
I'm sure I've heard that voice somewhere.

00:42:00.138 --> 00:42:03.338
Cha Min Uk? What brings you here?
Coming all this way to find me?

00:42:03.338 --> 00:42:04.538
I have something to ask you.

00:42:04.538 --> 00:42:05.805
Tsk, what is it?

00:42:05.805 --> 00:42:08.772
The baby's father, how did he look
at the OB-GYN?

00:42:08.772 --> 00:42:10.705
Do you happen to know what he does?

00:42:10.705 --> 00:42:12.605
- One tteokbokki here, please.
- Rolled omelet.

00:42:12.605 --> 00:42:13.872
One rolled omelet too, please.

00:42:13.872 --> 00:42:15.472
Got it. I'll make it delicious.

00:42:15.472 --> 00:42:17.538
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:42:17.538 --> 00:42:19.272
Hold on.

00:42:21.905 --> 00:42:24.709
You absolutely cannot tell Min Uk

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:28.638
that the father is the president
of our company, got it?

00:42:28.638 --> 00:42:30.105
I know, but...

00:42:30.105 --> 00:42:32.572
Won't he feel worse if he finds out later?

00:42:32.572 --> 00:42:33.905
Don't you remember?

00:42:33.905 --> 00:42:35.205
Back in college,

00:42:35.205 --> 00:42:37.472
Min Ji and Jae Hyun got caught

00:42:37.472 --> 00:42:39.238
dating in the club room.

00:42:39.238 --> 00:42:41.005
They begged the three of us
to keep it secret.

00:42:41.005 --> 00:42:42.905
But Cha Min Uk couldn't control
his expression and was fidgeting.

00:42:42.905 --> 00:42:45.272
Then the whole school found out in a week.

00:42:45.272 --> 00:42:47.472
Not a week, three days.

00:42:47.472 --> 00:42:48.472
Right, right!

00:42:48.472 --> 00:42:50.338
That legendary incident.

00:42:50.338 --> 00:42:53.005
He's completely transparent.
You can read everything on his face.

00:42:53.005 --> 00:42:55.105
Okay, got it. I'll keep it secret.

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:56.105
Promise.

00:42:56.105 --> 00:42:58.972
- Promise.
- Wow, unbelievable!

00:42:58.972 --> 00:43:00.172
Why? What is it?

00:43:00.172 --> 00:43:03.038
Jae Hyun and Min Ji are getting married.

00:43:03.805 --> 00:43:05.972
Did you guys know? They got back together?

00:43:05.972 --> 00:43:06.972
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:43:06.972 --> 00:43:10.138
And they're getting married just
three months after getting back together?

00:43:12.372 --> 00:43:13.905
Yeah.

00:43:13.905 --> 00:43:15.238
Yeah.

00:43:15.238 --> 00:43:16.272
How come I didn't know?

00:43:16.272 --> 00:43:17.938
Why didn't anyone tell me?

00:43:17.938 --> 00:43:19.938
- I'm good at keeping secrets.
- Yeah.

00:43:19.938 --> 00:43:21.638
I know.

00:43:24.357 --> 00:43:26.872
Well, I called Hui Won,

00:43:26.872 --> 00:43:27.905
and that guy just answered,

00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:29.738
said his piece, and hung up.

00:43:29.738 --> 00:43:30.738
Was it the same that day?

00:43:30.738 --> 00:43:33.005
Rude and inconsiderate?

00:43:33.005 --> 00:43:35.905
Well, I only saw him briefly,
so I don't clearly remember...

00:43:35.905 --> 00:43:39.072
Ugh, seriously, where did she
even meet a guy like that?

00:43:39.072 --> 00:43:42.372
By the way, you came all the way here
just to ask that?

00:43:42.372 --> 00:43:45.672
Do you like Hui Won or something?

00:43:45.672 --> 00:43:47.272
- Me?
- I mean,

00:43:47.272 --> 00:43:50.338
it's unlike you to suddenly
come over and interrogate me,

00:43:50.338 --> 00:43:52.672
and that you care whether he's a good guy.

00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:54.405
Hey, you!

00:43:55.472 --> 00:43:57.972
I've known her for ages.

00:43:57.972 --> 00:44:03.638
You know how she is. Is there anything
she does properly besides work?

00:44:03.638 --> 00:44:05.838
Well, that's true.

00:44:07.938 --> 00:44:10.305
But you came all the way here to ask that?

00:44:19.805 --> 00:44:22.038
I could have gone for the check-up alone.

00:44:22.038 --> 00:44:23.705
Hold on.

00:44:23.705 --> 00:44:25.438
Yes?

00:44:27.005 --> 00:44:28.772
What?

00:44:41.272 --> 00:44:43.738
Sorry, but is that...

00:44:43.738 --> 00:44:45.305
Huh?

00:44:45.305 --> 00:44:48.869
No, I thought you were pregnant.

00:44:48.869 --> 00:44:50.172
Ah.

00:44:50.172 --> 00:44:52.293
This is non-alcoholic.

00:44:52.293 --> 00:44:53.805
Oh.

00:44:53.805 --> 00:44:57.338
I actually get scolded by the elders here
a lot because of this.

00:44:57.338 --> 00:45:00.605
No matter how much I explain
it's just a drink, non-alcoholic, no less,

00:45:00.605 --> 00:45:04.038
the elders only believe
what they see and know.

00:45:04.038 --> 00:45:07.472
Right, it's understandable
they'd misunderstand.

00:45:07.472 --> 00:45:10.505
I try not to drink it much at the hospital.

00:45:10.505 --> 00:45:14.438
But lately, without even this,
I'd have no joy at all.

00:45:14.438 --> 00:45:16.738
My husband shows up dead drunk every night,

00:45:16.738 --> 00:45:18.805
whether I'm in the hospital or not.

00:45:18.805 --> 00:45:22.805
There are so many days I just
want to get completely drunk myself.

00:45:24.038 --> 00:45:28.338
A friend who got into the postpartum
care center before me snuck this in.

00:45:28.338 --> 00:45:30.505
Was it Taehan Liquor?

00:45:30.505 --> 00:45:32.805
I heard their president has been giving

00:45:32.805 --> 00:45:35.372
ten boxes of this non-alcoholic beer
to every postpartum care center lately.

00:45:35.372 --> 00:45:36.372
The president?

00:45:36.372 --> 00:45:42.005
Yes, he said it's a gift for mothers
who've endured so much

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:43.938
while carrying a child for ten months.

00:45:53.838 --> 00:45:55.505
Reporter Park,

00:45:55.505 --> 00:45:57.838
while you've been hushing up
the secret supplies to company sports events,

00:45:57.838 --> 00:46:02.505
soccer clubs, even a certain
politician's alumni association...

00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:08.505
Ugh, you idiot.

00:46:09.838 --> 00:46:12.677
Aren't mothers the ones
who really need a change of mood?

00:46:12.677 --> 00:46:15.238
Honey, I think the baby's coming.

00:46:15.238 --> 00:46:17.772
Honey, will it take long?

00:46:17.772 --> 00:46:19.905
Can I quickly grab a bite right here?

00:46:19.905 --> 00:46:21.438
- What?
- I'll be super quick.

00:46:21.438 --> 00:46:22.757
I'm just so hungry.

00:46:22.757 --> 00:46:24.338
Jeez.

00:46:24.338 --> 00:46:28.738
It's not about doing it for women.
It's about helping mothers.

00:46:32.138 --> 00:46:35.972
When the mother is at ease,
the baby will be comfortable too.

00:46:37.105 --> 00:46:40.472
Mothers are humans too.

00:47:01.605 --> 00:47:04.238
Thank you for today.

00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:05.972
I've already spoken to Team Leader Bang.

00:47:05.972 --> 00:47:08.172
Don't come to work
for a few days and rest well.

00:47:08.172 --> 00:47:10.372
Recovering your condition is
the most important thing right now.

00:47:10.372 --> 00:47:13.438
What? But it's the busiest time right now...

00:47:13.438 --> 00:47:14.738
I'm not just saying it.

00:47:14.738 --> 00:47:16.838
About your idea of domestic hops,

00:47:16.838 --> 00:47:19.838
we're planning to develop
a new product based on that concept.

00:47:19.838 --> 00:47:21.138
Really?

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:24.638
I've already marked a few viable items
from the ideas you submitted.

00:47:24.638 --> 00:47:27.472
We can start developing them
once you're back.

00:47:27.472 --> 00:47:30.338
And since we're on the topic,

00:47:30.338 --> 00:47:31.738
Ms. Jang Hui Won, about your dream,

00:47:31.738 --> 00:47:34.172
that study program in Germany
isn't your ultimate goal, is it?

00:47:34.172 --> 00:47:35.405
That's when I made up my mind.

00:47:35.405 --> 00:47:37.272
I've decided that I must
study in Germany next.

00:47:37.272 --> 00:47:40.872
I've decided to create my own beer
that will captivate foreigners' taste buds.

00:47:40.872 --> 00:47:41.972
That's my dream.

00:47:41.972 --> 00:47:46.572
Launching your own original brand.
Isn't that your ultimate goal?

00:47:47.205 --> 00:47:48.438
That's right, but...

00:47:48.438 --> 00:47:50.572
Then do you really need to go far away?

00:47:50.572 --> 00:47:52.172
Why not take on the challenge right here?

00:47:52.172 --> 00:47:56.238
That dream. I'll help make it possible.

00:47:56.238 --> 00:47:57.972
President.

00:47:57.972 --> 00:48:00.472
I'll respect whatever choice you make,

00:48:00.472 --> 00:48:03.905
but you shouldn't have regrets
about whichever path you take.

00:48:03.905 --> 00:48:05.205
I'm sorry.

00:48:05.205 --> 00:48:06.905
Thinking back,

00:48:06.905 --> 00:48:10.005
I was only pushing my own position.

00:48:32.638 --> 00:48:34.372
Mom!

00:48:38.272 --> 00:48:40.172
Ugh, what now?

00:48:40.172 --> 00:48:41.438
Mom, if you keep that up,

00:48:41.438 --> 00:48:45.038
I'll play conservative around you,
then go all out the second I step outside.

00:48:45.038 --> 00:48:46.757
I can't stand Gen Z.

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:48.453
Tsk.

00:48:50.905 --> 00:48:54.172
They say the internal performance evaluation
will include individual presentations

00:48:54.172 --> 00:48:56.138
and project participation rates.

00:48:56.138 --> 00:48:58.972
Just step up saying you'd do everything,
without skipping anything.

00:48:58.972 --> 00:49:00.472
That's exactly your problem, Mom.

00:49:00.472 --> 00:49:03.038
It's like teaching bike riding
to a kid who just learned to walk.

00:49:03.038 --> 00:49:05.272
You said you hate parachuting no matter what.

00:49:05.272 --> 00:49:07.205
Then you have to stand out
through your own efforts.

00:49:07.205 --> 00:49:09.372
Mom, I'm still an intern.

00:49:09.372 --> 00:49:12.705
And for management issues,
there's Uncle, so... whatever.

00:49:12.705 --> 00:49:14.605
Taehan Liquor is yours.

00:49:14.605 --> 00:49:16.572
You need to think of yourself as the owner.

00:49:16.572 --> 00:49:20.105
It's not that I don't have ambition.
I just want to rise based on my own skills.

00:49:20.105 --> 00:49:22.138
- And what if your chance never comes?
- Huh?

00:49:22.138 --> 00:49:23.705
Your uncle has a woman, and a kid too.

00:49:23.705 --> 00:49:25.372
Do you even talk to Uncle
about things like that?

00:49:25.372 --> 00:49:28.272
What if they end up getting married?

00:49:30.738 --> 00:49:32.272
Forget it.

00:49:32.272 --> 00:49:34.305
Do you know how they met?

00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:35.472
I don't know that much.

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:38.305
I wouldn't have known either if I hadn't seen
them at the OB-GYN.

00:49:38.305 --> 00:49:39.338
OB-GYN?

00:49:39.338 --> 00:49:41.938
But they seemed like strangers back then...

00:49:41.938 --> 00:49:43.272
What are you talking about?

00:49:43.272 --> 00:49:45.505
Huh?

00:49:45.505 --> 00:49:46.672
Nothing, it's nothing.

00:49:46.672 --> 00:49:49.538
Aren't you hungry, Mom?
Why do I suddenly feel peckish?

00:49:49.538 --> 00:49:50.565
What do you want to have?

00:49:50.565 --> 00:49:53.672
I'm feeling a bit peckish.

00:49:54.738 --> 00:49:55.941
You caught the culprit?

00:49:55.941 --> 00:49:58.872
Ah, Manager Jang, you weren't
here that day, so you missed it.

00:49:58.872 --> 00:50:00.872
It was utter chaos since the morning.

00:50:00.872 --> 00:50:02.705
You know Team Leader Shin
from Marketing Team?

00:50:02.705 --> 00:50:04.773
We are the Audit Team.

00:50:04.773 --> 00:50:07.038
Yes, what's the matter?

00:50:07.038 --> 00:50:08.338
What are you waiting for? Pack his things.

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:09.872
Was he not happy with this year's
salary negotiation?

00:50:09.872 --> 00:50:12.138
Looks like he was even lining up another job.

00:50:12.138 --> 00:50:13.618
You know Director Park from Sales

00:50:13.618 --> 00:50:15.805
who jumped ship
to a competitor about a month ago?

00:50:15.805 --> 00:50:17.905
He teamed up
with that Team Leader Baek on their side,

00:50:17.905 --> 00:50:20.205
and set up the meeting in exchange

00:50:20.205 --> 00:50:22.438
for selling off our new product information.

00:50:22.438 --> 00:50:25.205
The competitor thought the idea
was solid and rushed it forward.

00:50:25.205 --> 00:50:27.005
But President Kang caught onto it.

00:50:27.005 --> 00:50:29.072
- How?
- During the team leader meeting,

00:50:29.072 --> 00:50:31.472
he overheard Team Leader Shin
making a call as soon as he stepped out.

00:50:31.472 --> 00:50:34.138
He heard something like, 'Make sure
you clean it up if the leak gets exposed.'

00:50:34.138 --> 00:50:38.205
That sparked his suspicion,
and he got Audit Team to gather evidence.

00:50:38.205 --> 00:50:40.405
Did you think you wouldn't get caught?

00:50:40.405 --> 00:50:43.738
Or did you think even if caught,
you'd make a hefty profit anyway?

00:50:43.738 --> 00:50:44.805
President Kang, that's...

00:50:44.805 --> 00:50:45.838
I don't need excuses.

00:50:45.838 --> 00:50:47.338
Just take responsibility.

00:50:47.338 --> 00:50:49.872
You were expecting criminal punishment
when you did this, right?

00:50:49.872 --> 00:50:51.505
Um, President...

00:50:51.505 --> 00:50:53.272
I've committed an unforgivable sin.

00:50:53.272 --> 00:50:58.205
Team Leader Shin, you seem to be quite lucky.

00:50:58.205 --> 00:51:01.172
Because I happen to have a lot of time today.

00:51:01.172 --> 00:51:03.938
Let's go over exactly
how much damage the company took

00:51:03.938 --> 00:51:06.305
because of the new product leak.

00:51:06.305 --> 00:51:08.038
President.

00:51:08.038 --> 00:51:10.738
Anyway, it's still not over,
but it seems to have worked out.

00:51:10.738 --> 00:51:12.438
I see.

00:51:12.438 --> 00:51:13.672
That's a relief.

00:51:13.672 --> 00:51:17.238
Also, President Kang said once Manager Jang
comes back, we'd have a team dinner.

00:51:17.238 --> 00:51:18.705
Not this, though.

00:51:18.705 --> 00:51:21.872
He gave this monetary gift.

00:51:21.872 --> 00:51:23.105
President Kang did?

00:51:23.105 --> 00:51:27.772
Isn't it his way of acknowledging
how you struggled alone to save the team?

00:51:27.772 --> 00:51:29.105
He acts cold, but he's
actually soft underneath.

00:51:29.105 --> 00:51:31.205
- Totally.
- Just like me.

00:51:38.172 --> 00:51:41.205
[Beer Recipe]

00:51:41.205 --> 00:51:43.653
[Beer Recipe]

00:52:03.705 --> 00:52:05.405
Okay.

00:52:07.072 --> 00:52:10.373
[Study in Germany. This time,
I'm going. No matter what!]

00:52:18.505 --> 00:52:22.949
[Beer Recipe]

00:52:32.972 --> 00:52:34.038
Team Leader!

00:52:34.038 --> 00:52:35.838
Huh?

00:52:37.938 --> 00:52:40.572
I won't be going to Germany.

00:52:40.572 --> 00:52:43.472
I'm giving up on the study program.

00:52:48.197 --> 00:52:49.861
What?

00:52:57.205 --> 00:53:00.572
As mentioned earlier, Team Leader Shin
will be dismissed as soon as possible.

00:53:00.572 --> 00:53:04.872
And we'll handle the legal work properly,
with our in-house lawyer involved.

00:53:07.538 --> 00:53:09.638
President Kang Du Jun.

00:53:09.638 --> 00:53:12.538
I said we'd follow the procedures.

00:53:12.538 --> 00:53:15.605
Yes, keep me updated
as the lawsuit progresses.

00:53:15.605 --> 00:53:17.038
Is that all for today's schedule?

00:53:17.038 --> 00:53:18.538
Yeah, heading straight home?

00:53:18.538 --> 00:53:19.572
I guess so.

00:53:19.572 --> 00:53:20.672
Wait, no.

00:53:20.672 --> 00:53:23.238
Come to think of it,
I set up the dinner gathering.

00:53:23.238 --> 00:53:25.138
Wouldn't they feel disappointed if I skip it?

00:53:25.138 --> 00:53:27.972
Don't tell me you're going to
the New Product Development Team's dinner?

00:53:27.972 --> 00:53:29.405
I was thinking about it.

00:53:29.405 --> 00:53:31.005
They might be eagerly waiting for me.

00:53:31.005 --> 00:53:33.405
Do you know who the coolest person
at a company dinner is?

00:53:33.405 --> 00:53:36.105
The president who just pays
and doesn't attend.

00:53:36.105 --> 00:53:37.805
No.

00:53:37.805 --> 00:53:40.438
Making an appearance
is basic presidential etiquette.

00:53:40.438 --> 00:53:41.805
Let's go.

00:53:41.805 --> 00:53:44.038
I said it's not etiquette!

00:53:44.038 --> 00:53:45.472
Nobody's waiting for you.

00:53:45.472 --> 00:53:47.372
- Try!
- Try!

00:53:49.805 --> 00:53:51.305
But why would she give up?

00:53:51.305 --> 00:53:52.972
That's the mystery.

00:53:52.972 --> 00:53:54.005
Maybe she's sick?

00:53:54.005 --> 00:53:56.738
Is it because people think she got
bonus points to study abroad?

00:53:56.738 --> 00:53:59.938
So why did you take
Team Leader Bang's side back then?

00:53:59.938 --> 00:54:01.705
Oh, Manager Jang.

00:54:03.638 --> 00:54:08.638
Assistant Manager Choi wants to treat you
to a drink to clear up the misunderstanding.

00:54:11.538 --> 00:54:15.005
Oh, Manager Jang.

00:54:15.005 --> 00:54:16.538
My apol...

00:54:16.538 --> 00:54:19.572
You'll accept my apology, right?

00:54:24.038 --> 00:54:26.838
No, I'd love to drink too,

00:54:26.838 --> 00:54:30.405
but I'm on herbal medicine these days.

00:54:30.405 --> 00:54:31.605
My peace offering drink.

00:54:31.605 --> 00:54:33.072
See? She's not accepting it.

00:54:33.072 --> 00:54:35.038
No, that's not what I meant.

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:36.338
Oh, Assistant Manager Choi, good work today.

00:54:36.338 --> 00:54:38.705
But we're really curious,

00:54:38.705 --> 00:54:40.705
why did you suddenly
decide not to go to Germany?

00:54:40.705 --> 00:54:42.972
Isn't this what all the fuss is about?

00:54:42.972 --> 00:54:46.905
I realized there's something
I need to stay and handle.

00:54:46.905 --> 00:54:50.538
I can achieve my dreams here too.

00:54:50.538 --> 00:54:54.638
Why dig into someone who's not going?

00:54:54.638 --> 00:54:56.405
Since we're gathered because of you,

00:54:56.405 --> 00:54:59.705
down a drink to kick things off.

00:54:59.705 --> 00:55:00.838
- Me?
- Why?

00:55:00.838 --> 00:55:03.905
You're refusing a drink
from your team leader?

00:55:06.338 --> 00:55:07.505
I'll drink it for her. Give it to me.

00:55:07.505 --> 00:55:09.938
Hey, since when does an intern get so bold?

00:55:09.938 --> 00:55:13.138
Manager Jang, my arm's getting tired.

00:55:13.138 --> 00:55:16.238
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

00:55:16.238 --> 00:55:20.672
Down it! Chug, chug, chug, chug.

00:55:20.672 --> 00:55:22.438
How long will you keep us waiting?

00:55:22.438 --> 00:55:24.305
Pretend to take the glass
and accidentally spill it?

00:55:24.305 --> 00:55:26.238
Or pretending to drink
and then throwing up right away?

00:55:26.238 --> 00:55:28.305
Ah, this is driving me crazy.

00:55:28.305 --> 00:55:31.305
Does this forced-drinking culture
still exist nowadays?

00:55:41.445 --> 00:55:43.237
Oh my!

00:55:46.905 --> 00:55:50.072
Wow, our president is amazing.

00:56:07.072 --> 00:56:09.605
Is the star of the night leaving already?

00:56:10.305 --> 00:56:11.605
Are you drunk?

00:56:11.605 --> 00:56:12.738
No.

00:56:12.738 --> 00:56:15.672
Just pleasantly buzzed?

00:56:38.005 --> 00:56:39.738
Drink with me.

00:56:40.805 --> 00:56:42.772
I have to drive,

00:56:42.772 --> 00:56:44.705
so it's just water.

00:56:52.773 --> 00:56:54.072
Oh.

00:56:54.072 --> 00:56:56.905
That's okay, I'll stop now.

00:57:00.805 --> 00:57:01.805
Why?

00:57:01.805 --> 00:57:03.005
I don't want to get drunk.

00:57:03.005 --> 00:57:04.938
And I don't want to look stupid
in front of juniors.

00:57:04.938 --> 00:57:06.605
Then,

00:57:06.605 --> 00:57:09.238
only get drunk in front of me.

00:57:09.238 --> 00:57:11.305
I can't do that.

00:57:11.305 --> 00:57:13.372
I hate

00:57:13.372 --> 00:57:15.838
how I act when I'm drunk.

00:57:15.838 --> 00:57:17.005
Why?

00:57:17.005 --> 00:57:20.038
People say I start acting cute

00:57:20.038 --> 00:57:22.872
when I'm drunk.

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:24.638
You are cute.

00:57:27.438 --> 00:57:30.538
It's not acting, because you just are.

00:57:41.672 --> 00:57:44.672
You seemed to drink pretty well today.

00:57:44.672 --> 00:57:46.738
Why? Do I seem different to you?

00:57:46.738 --> 00:57:49.538
Ugh, I can't even say anything.

00:57:51.105 --> 00:57:52.905
I drank a bit because of the two of you.

00:57:52.905 --> 00:57:54.605
The two of us?

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:59.872
The baby and I are already a package deal.

00:57:59.872 --> 00:58:02.105
Why? Does that bother you?

00:58:02.105 --> 00:58:04.605
Forget it, seriously.

00:58:10.738 --> 00:58:12.505
Thank you.

00:58:12.505 --> 00:58:16.705
I heard you caught the real culprit for me.

00:58:17.772 --> 00:58:20.272
Even when I went to the hospital before,

00:58:20.272 --> 00:58:23.872
I didn't say it, but I felt supported.

00:58:24.738 --> 00:58:27.338
When you said you'd help me achieve my dream,

00:58:27.338 --> 00:58:30.838
and that you'd respect any choice I make...

00:58:32.972 --> 00:58:35.205
So here's the thing.

00:58:36.872 --> 00:58:39.338
I'm going to keep this baby.

00:58:46.338 --> 00:58:49.738
This doesn't mean
I'm marrying you or anything,

00:58:49.738 --> 00:58:51.972
so don't misunderstand.

00:58:54.772 --> 00:58:56.838
Then what about taking it slow?

00:58:56.838 --> 00:58:58.738
Is that not possible either?

00:58:59.905 --> 00:59:02.605
- Pardon?
- Since you've decided to keep it,

00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:04.772
I don't want to stop here.

00:59:11.372 --> 00:59:13.272
There she is!

00:59:13.272 --> 00:59:15.338
- Get her!
- Get her!

00:59:15.338 --> 00:59:17.372
- Get her.
- Get her!

00:59:17.372 --> 00:59:18.572
- Get her!
- Get her!

00:59:18.572 --> 00:59:20.338
We have to catch her!

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:37.405
- Where do you think you're running to?
- Don't you leave right now.

00:59:37.405 --> 00:59:38.605
We have to go to the second round!

00:59:38.605 --> 00:59:39.638
Let's all go together!

00:59:39.638 --> 00:59:41.072
Boss, come with us!

00:59:41.072 --> 00:59:42.805
Second round! Karaoke!

00:59:42.805 --> 00:59:44.572
Our second round is karaoke.

00:59:44.572 --> 00:59:47.138
Karaoke!

00:59:49.972 --> 00:59:52.372
- Ah, I'll should go.
- Karaoke.

00:59:52.372 --> 00:59:56.405
Karaoke!

00:59:56.405 --> 00:59:59.138
Karaoke!

00:59:59.138 --> 01:00:02.205
Karaoke!

01:00:02.205 --> 01:00:04.138
Karao...

01:00:58.705 --> 01:01:01.072
Why don't you tell the company
and take some rest?

01:01:01.072 --> 01:01:02.838
Whether I finish it or hand it over,

01:01:02.838 --> 01:01:04.572
I want to decide my own ending.

01:01:04.572 --> 01:01:06.038
A field trip? Just the two of them?

01:01:06.038 --> 01:01:10.038
Wouldn't it hurt more if someone
you trusted betrayed you?

01:01:10.038 --> 01:01:12.405
Could there be some story she can't tell us?

01:01:12.405 --> 01:01:15.238
That makes sense. She's been
acting suspicious lately.

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:16.272
Do you want to go to the hospital?

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:17.438
I'll go with you.

01:01:17.438 --> 01:01:19.438
If anyone sees, they'll misunderstand.

01:01:19.438 --> 01:01:20.805
While you're thinking about this,

01:01:20.805 --> 01:01:22.905
where is he, and what is he doing?

01:01:22.905 --> 01:01:25.438
Maybe it's better not to start at all.

01:01:25.438 --> 01:01:27.038
I've never thought of it that way.

01:01:27.038 --> 01:01:29.572
Do you think I'm playing games with you?
