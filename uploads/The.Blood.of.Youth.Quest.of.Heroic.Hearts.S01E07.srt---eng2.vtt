00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.440
Only an idiot thinks you won't feel pain in a dream.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.150
Since we're already in a dream,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.790
we might as well

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.390
sleep more.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.000
What should we do now then?

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.790
Let's go out and check.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:31.910
Come.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.440
Let's go.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.080
The hour of Zi is near.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.150
The matrimonial ritual...

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.000
- It's him again. - ...will be carried out soon.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.840
Hurry up and take this

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.960
to the bride's chamber.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.120
Speak.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.960
What did you do to the Divine Maiden?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.750
Hurry up and take this

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.750
to the bride's chamber.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.000
Quit saying riddles.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.360
How dare

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.440
you ruined my wedding ceremony.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.960
Die!

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:14.870
Let's go.
