00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:08.500
Influencers are in turmoil this week.

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:10.958
From September 30th to October 5th,

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:13.000
an influencer died every single day.

00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:14.125
This victim

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.083
was an influencer surnamed Lin.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.583
-He got into arguments online…
-…a local found a body floating.

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:23.833
The family confirmed that the deceased
is a well-known influencer.

00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:25.625
Police aren't ruling out homicide.

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:27.416
We'll get to the bottom of it.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.083
-I'm reporting from…
-I'm sorry.

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.958
-We can't comment…
-where the incident happened.

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:35.208
A psychic influencer predicted a death.

00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:37.125
She shows up wearing a mask.

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:40.458
And she runs her channel by drawing cards.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:43.708
Could she be linked to these incidents,
given what happened?

00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:45.041
Hello, everyone.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:47.875
-Welcome to Witch Baba. I'm Baba.
-Within ten minutes,

00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.583
-the fifth victim appeared.
-Last time, I predicted a car accident.

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.958
It did happen, right?

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.333
OCTOBER 1ST

00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:03.125
SIX DAYS AGO

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:13.041
STAY WARM, IT'S GETTING CHILLY

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:14.291
YU-CHIEH

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:16.916
SHARE

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.291
GOOD MORNING, SUNRISE AND HOPE

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:23.500
BUNDLE UP! BE SAFE!

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.583
STAY WARM

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.041
FRIED RICE'S ON THE SHOE RACK
REMEMBER TO EAT IT

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.291
TAKE MEDICINE

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:37.208
STOP

00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:58.125
Well, there was a car accident.

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:05.958
Hello, everyone.

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:09.166
Welcome to Witch Baba. I'm Baba.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.375
Today is September 30th.

00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:13.875
The food safety issue that I predicted

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.000
actually came true.

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:18.166
When you're eating out,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.916
you need to be really careful.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.375
Wash your hands before eating
to keep viruses away.

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:27.708
Baba's obsessed with dessert.

00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:30.541
Oh, by the way, have you had Sweet Spot's…

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:33.541
They have this delicious cake.

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:35.750
The cream isn't too rich.

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:38.708
I'm craving it just thinking about it now.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.125
Like lemon tarts,

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:42.375
brownies,

00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:43.833
crème brûlée.

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:46.083
Matcha cake is great too.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.166
What's your favorite dessert?

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.166
Leave a comment and let Baba know.

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:56.125
All right, that's about it for today.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:59.000
Let's make our next prediction.

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:01.208
I wonder what message

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:03.541
the cards have for us today.

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:06.125
The Armory upright.

00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:08.166
The Pyramid reversed.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.541
John F. Kennedy reversed.

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.208
In the future,

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:16.875
someone will be shot and killed.

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.041
Didn't you say work…

00:03:57.583 --> 00:03:58.875
Put the gun down!

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:03.250
Put the gun down!

00:04:05.541 --> 00:04:06.375
Drop it.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.708
Put the gun down.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.250
-Drop it.
-Sir, put it down.

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:12.250
Drop the gun!

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:15.166
-Drop the gun, you hear me?
-Stay back!

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:16.708
Drop it!

00:04:23.541 --> 00:04:25.208
-Is that Wei Yen?
-I think so.

00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:31.291
Okay.

00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:33.833
I'll put the gun down.

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:36.083
-Don't come closer!
-Be careful.

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:38.083
Put the gun down, okay? Get back!

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:40.333
Step back. Listen, let's calm down.

00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:43.625
Put the gun down, okay?

00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:45.166
-Stay back!
-Calm down!

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:50.166
Let's talk, okay?

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.541
Drop the gun.

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.125
You don't want to do this.

00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:55.208
In the future,

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:58.416
someone will be shot and killed.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.750
-Let's talk it out.
-Put the gun down!

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.333
Stop filming.

00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.083
Don't come closer. Get back.

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:24.541
Get outta here!

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:25.458
Get back!

00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:27.250
-A-Hua, are you okay?
-Get back.

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:28.166
I'm fine!

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.041
-Ambulance!
-Ambulance!

00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:31.458
-You okay?
-Call 911!

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:32.750
Back off! Stop filming!

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:36.125
-Stop filming!
-Get back!

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:37.833
Back off.

00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:39.083
Stop filming.

00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:41.291
Stop filming.

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:42.666
Get back!

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.583
-Isn't that Wei Yen?
-Who?

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:46.875
Hey, stop filming!

00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.458
Take control of the scene!

00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:50.416
That influencer, "Wei Fa Yen".

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.625
You mean the Wei Yen?

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:54.833
Yes, Wei Meng-yen.

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.166
Get back.

00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:04.500
CID AGENT

00:06:04.583 --> 00:06:05.500
BB Pellets.

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:07.916
It's a BB gun.

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:10.000
What?

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:17.375
Stop filming!

00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:19.666
Back off! Stop filming!

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.916
-That's terrifying!
-Jeez!

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.125
-Unbelievable!
-Shocking!

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:23.416
-Is it live?
-It's a Story.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.458
What's wrong with Taiwan?

00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:26.708
-Latest news.
-Big stunt.

00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:28.166
Was he shot dead?

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.583
Put the gun down!

00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:32.000
THE POLICE FIRED A SHOT!

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:32.958
Look…

00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:34.500
POLICE GOT SHOT?
POLICE WAS FINE

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:35.958
IT'S A CRIME SCENE
TERRIFYING

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:37.250
WHAT'RE THEY DOING?

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:38.458
MURDERER
HE FIRED

00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.916
Get outta here!

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.541
-Wei Yen got shot.
-Seriously?

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:42.958
-The influencer?
-Wei Fa Yen.

00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:43.916
He went too far.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.208
Don't try this at home.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.166
Get outta here!

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:49.500
WEI

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:51.708
Welcome to my channel, Wei Fa Yen.

00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:53.833
Hey!

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:55.666
-The Wei Yen?
-Oh my god.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.458
-He was bleeding.
-Seriously?

00:06:57.541 --> 00:06:58.458
It was terrifying.

00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:00.291
-Influencer got shot.
-Fake news?

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:01.958
Comment if you have any evidence.

00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:03.833
Please help Wei Yen.

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.375
I heard he's just unconscious?

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:07.666
Chest shot. He's dead.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.125
He's not dead yet.

00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:12.166
-Firing there was badass.
-Fatal incident, live.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.375
The joke went too far.

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:14.916
-Jeez!
-Badass? It's suicidal.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.083
-Wei Yen took it too far.
-It's Taiwan. What do you expect?

00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:21.458
-It's just a BB gun.
-A BB pellet got someone killed!

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.041
Did you watch until the end?
He had a BB gun.

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:27.083
They couldn't tell?

00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:28.625
It was just a BB gun.

00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:29.666
Is he really dead?

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.500
-That's hilarious.
-He's gone viral.

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:33.166
A BB pellet got someone killed!

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.541
-Someone died.
-A BB gun?

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:36.166
Choosing clicks over his life.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.250
-Who fired?
-A cop.

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:38.166
A cop killed him!

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:41.208
-Chen Chia-jen.
-Who is Chen Chia-jen?

00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:43.083
-A cop shot an influencer.
-Dox him.

00:07:43.166 --> 00:07:44.458
-He went too far.
-For views.

00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:46.041
-I support the police.
-Justified.

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:47.916
Which idiot supports the police?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.166
Ting-yu commented.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.000
-Comment if you have any evidence.
-Ting-yu's stepping in.

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:53.958
-I saw Wei Yen at the ER.
-Which hospital?

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:55.208
He was at the hospital?

00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:58.416
-Is he live-streaming?
-No idea. I didn't see it.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.250
-Is he a moron?
-Watch your mouth.

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:01.166
He acted odd.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.291
-The cop fired without checking?
-He's brave.

00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:08.541
Hello? I saw it.

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:11.458
How would I know?

00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:14.625
I'm going to the hospital.

00:08:14.708 --> 00:08:15.875
They found which one.

00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.291
-Any news?
-Which hospital is it?

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.000
Hekeng Hospital.

00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:23.125
-Oh my god.
-Shocking.

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:25.125
-It's a Story.
-Taipei City First Precinct.

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:26.666
-Wei Yen got shot.
-That Wei Yen?

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.541
Did BBs get someone killed?

00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:22.416
EMERGENCY ROOM

00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:32.166
Why is the High-Tech Crime Unit here?

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.500
Chia-jen, the shooter is an influencer.

00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:37.666
The netizens are all focused
on this incident now.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.416
The chief wants us to be careful.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.500
We should get ahead
of the suspect's online footprint

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:43.708
to confirm his motive.

00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:46.625
What's an influencer?

00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:49.583
Someone who posts videos online
to gain popularity.

00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:53.833
Wei Meng-yen is an influencer.
He's 27. His channel's "Wei Fa Yen".

00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:57.875
He has over a million followers,
now they're all coming after you.

00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.125
What was that?

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:00.916
"Wei Fa Yen".

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:04.333
Why did First Precinct send him to Hekeng?

00:10:04.916 --> 00:10:07.250
Their guys were there
and called 911 immediately.

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:10.083
Within an hour, your shooting video

00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:12.291
already has 200,000 views.

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.583
Chia-jen, you're also an influencer now.

00:10:16.166 --> 00:10:17.416
Put the gun down!

00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:19.916
They think you're a killer.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.750
-We need to handle this carefully.
-I fired lawfully.

00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:30.416
What's taking so long? What's going on?

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.291
Hey, the doctor's here…

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:33.208
Doctor…

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:35.416
How is my son?

00:10:36.083 --> 00:10:38.666
The bullet penetrated
his body cavity and his ribs

00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:40.916
and stopped in the lower left lung.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.583
Luckily, his heart wasn't damaged.

00:10:43.666 --> 00:10:44.791
We removed the bullet.

00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:46.458
But…

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:47.791
his wound is large,

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:50.041
so his condition isn't stable yet.

00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:51.750
I'm sorry.

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:53.000
Meng-yen.

00:10:56.541 --> 00:10:57.541
Meng-yen.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:10:59.000
Don't cry.

00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:03.625
Look…

00:11:05.416 --> 00:11:06.291
Are you that cop?

00:11:08.083 --> 00:11:09.458
You are that cop.

00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:10.375
-What?
-Calm down.

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:12.041
-Why did you shoot him?
-Stay back.

00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:13.291
-Back off.
-Get back.

00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:15.000
Are toy guns against the law?

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:16.083
-Please?
-Stay back.

00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:17.583
Is killing fun for you?

00:11:17.666 --> 00:11:18.916
-No…
-Why are you hiding?

00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:21.583
Let me introduce him.

00:11:21.666 --> 00:11:23.625
This is the killer cop.

00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:25.333
What's his name?

00:11:25.416 --> 00:11:26.916
Chen Chia-jen.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.166
The famous Officer Chen

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.583
is now the famous killer.

00:11:30.666 --> 00:11:32.708
-Say a few words.
-Stop it.

00:11:33.875 --> 00:11:35.583
-Put your phone down.
-Speak up.

00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:36.750
Too scared to talk?

00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:39.083
You can kill, but you can't talk?

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.166
Hey!

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.083
You call yourself an influencer?
Loser. You're all losers!

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:45.791
-Come here!
-You're the loser!

00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:47.041
Chia-jen.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.250
Enough, Chia-jen.

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.291
Don't stir things up. Let's go.

00:11:52.541 --> 00:11:53.458
Let's go.

00:12:06.833 --> 00:12:07.708
…can't talk?

00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:08.916
Hey.

00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:13.500
You call yourself an influencer?
Loser. You're all losers!

00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:15.750
You're all losers!

00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.541
THE COP HIT HIM
COPS ARE LOSERS

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.958
Hello?

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:40.583
Hey, calm yourself down.

00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:42.083
Why should I calm down?

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:44.125
Don't attack the police.

00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:47.958
Fuck, he shot Wei Yen.
You saw the live stream, right?

00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:49.458
What's with his attitude?

00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:50.500
He pushed me.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.375
What?

00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:53.708
When Wei Yen fired the gun,

00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:57.458
he didn't bring his phone
or any recording equipment.

00:12:58.166 --> 00:12:59.625
And he didn't ask anyone to film.

00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:01.208
So?

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:05.916
I don't think he was filming content.

00:13:10.041 --> 00:13:12.875
-What was he doing then?
-I don't know.

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:17.041
Listen.

00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:19.000
Have you heard of Witch Baba?

00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:19.958
What?

00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:21.833
What are you talking about?

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.541
Fine. Never mind.

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:25.208
I'll explain later.

00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:27.291
What the fuck?

00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:43.750
OCTOBER 2ND

00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:51.666
"Baba Van…"

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.916
LITTLE ARMSTRONG FILMS VIDEOS

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.833
Hey.

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:58.458
Check it out.

00:13:58.541 --> 00:13:59.458
Check out what?

00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.000
Witch Baba.

00:14:01.083 --> 00:14:01.916
Witch Baba?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.416
WITCH BABA

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.750
Last time,

00:14:06.833 --> 00:14:08.791
the fire happened.

00:14:08.875 --> 00:14:12.541
Next, there will be a car accident.

00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:14.041
It did happen, right?

00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:17.000
Next, a train will derail.

00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:20.333
TRAIN DERAILMENT
REPORTED IN JAPAN YESTERDAY

00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:24.791
Damn.

00:14:26.083 --> 00:14:27.250
Who is she?

00:14:31.458 --> 00:14:32.791
A psychic.

00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:41.875
Hello, everyone.

00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.708
Welcome to Witch Baba.

00:14:43.791 --> 00:14:45.333
I'm Baba.

00:14:45.416 --> 00:14:47.750
Today is September 30th.

00:14:47.833 --> 00:14:50.541
-The food safety issue I predicted…
-September 30th.

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:52.791
…actually came true.

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:55.625
When you're eating out, you need…

00:14:58.416 --> 00:15:00.125
-October 1st.
-Look.

00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:02.041
WEI YEN SHOOTING LIVE STREAM, SCARY

00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:10.916
I wonder what message
the cards have for us today.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.041
WEI YEN LIVE STREAM

00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:14.000
Get outta here!

00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:26.750
BABA'S FOOD PICKS

00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:28.875
BABA'S RAFFLE

00:15:29.708 --> 00:15:30.791
Sir.

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:33.083
I've compiled a file
on yesterday's shooting.

00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:34.166
Take a look.

00:15:38.458 --> 00:15:40.083
INTERNET WITCH MANIPULATING CRIMES

00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:42.125
The Armory upright.

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:43.750
The Pyramid reversed.

00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:45.666
John F. Kennedy reversed.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.500
In the future,

00:15:47.583 --> 00:15:50.333
someone will be shot and killed.

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:54.666
Do kids nowadays
actually watch this stuff?

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.166
Sir, let me explain it to you.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.208
Actually,

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.458
it's a gimmick for the channel.

00:16:00.541 --> 00:16:02.208
-But the predictions--
-A gimmick?

00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:05.708
What does this
have to do with the shooting?

00:16:06.916 --> 00:16:09.083
You're in the High-Tech Crime Unit.

00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:11.750
And you believe some internet prediction?

00:16:12.333 --> 00:16:14.000
No, I don't believe it.

00:16:14.083 --> 00:16:15.541
But she somehow managed

00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:17.458
to make this prediction look real.

00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:20.458
That way, yesterday's shooting
would be linked to her.

00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:23.916
And even though we know this isn't real…

00:16:26.916 --> 00:16:28.500
CHANG CHIEH
CHIEF OF CRIME INVESTIGATION

00:16:28.583 --> 00:16:29.416
Go on.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.333
Okay.

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.458
This one.

00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:37.291
Sir, look at this one.

00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:40.541
Since last January, Witch Baba

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.583
has predicted car accidents, fires,

00:16:42.666 --> 00:16:44.666
major political cases, vaccine rollouts.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.583
She even predicted a drought.

00:16:46.666 --> 00:16:50.125
The earliest was two months ahead,
and she's 100% accurate.

00:16:50.208 --> 00:16:53.000
UTurn's upload times can't be fabricated.

00:16:53.583 --> 00:16:54.791
So for her followers,

00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:56.500
these are real predictions.

00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:59.166
If Witch Baba has 100,000 followers,

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.541
and these followers all believe her,

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:04.000
then the predictions become real.

00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:11.375
Ho Chen-wei.

00:17:11.458 --> 00:17:12.708
Do you agree with this?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.750
Sir.

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:16.333
Online, anything's possible.

00:17:16.833 --> 00:17:19.166
As police, we build cases
based on evidence.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.291
I won't randomly target an influencer

00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:23.125
based on online buzz.

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:27.500
Anything else?

00:17:27.583 --> 00:17:29.875
We're looking into
Wei Meng-yen's social circle.

00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.125
We also know where he bought the BB gun.

00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:34.416
Now we wait for him to wake up.

00:17:35.708 --> 00:17:37.708
Have you contacted his family?

00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:39.875
His family isn't cooperating.

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.125
They won't give us his phone or computer.

00:17:42.208 --> 00:17:44.416
Chia-jen,
you're lucky they didn't press charges.

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:49.958
Chen Chia-jen.

00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:52.791
I want you to find out why Wei Meng-yen

00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:54.875
brought a BB gun to the police station.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.166
Sir, Chia-jen is a person of interest now.

00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.083
Clean up your own mess.

00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:03.750
What about the higher-ups?

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.208
I'll handle them.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.125
Okay.

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:09.208
Hey!

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:12.125
Bring her along.

00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:20.750
What am I, a babysitter?

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.416
You mean a public servant?

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.583
According to the internet,
you're the enemy.

00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:27.208
I'd quit if that scared me.

00:18:27.291 --> 00:18:28.125
Chen Chia-jen.

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:30.583
Can't you see
he came to the police station

00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:32.000
to get shot on purpose?

00:18:32.083 --> 00:18:34.833
If you don't clear your name,
there'll be more trouble.

00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:38.958
Don't forget you're still on a warning.

00:18:42.458 --> 00:18:43.416
Wait.

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.875
Give me a report on the shooting.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.583
Hello, everyone.

00:18:58.666 --> 00:19:02.000
Welcome to Witch Baba. I'm Baba…

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:02.958
I'll get going.

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.666
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.291
…the food safety issue I predicted

00:19:07.375 --> 00:19:09.541
actually came true.

00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:11.958
When you're eating out

00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:14.666
ILLUMINATI TAROT

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.041
Wash your hands before eating
to keep viruses away.

00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:21.458
Baba's obsessed with dessert.

00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:22.500
Oh, by the way,

00:19:22.583 --> 00:19:24.000
have you had Sweet Spot's…

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:27.666
They have this delicious cake.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.041
The cream isn't too rich.

00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:33.125
I'm craving it just thinking about it now.

00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:17.041

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.458
I'll deliver it for you.

00:20:22.666 --> 00:20:24.375
I can deliver it tonight.

00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:26.208
Let me do it.

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:31.166
Seriously, it's fine.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.958
-Because it's--
-I said I'll deliver it.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.375
What are you pissed about now?

00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:02.583
Yeh Pin-hsuan!

00:21:11.083 --> 00:21:13.375

Let's party!

00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:04.541
I think he looks like a birthday boy.

00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:06.000
Hey, buddy…

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.375

actually came true.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:40.125
When you're eating out,

00:23:40.208 --> 00:23:42.500
you need to be really careful.

Oh, by the way,

Why bother? Just check his call logs.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.458
People rarely make calls nowadays.

00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:27.333
They send messages instead.

00:24:33.541 --> 00:24:36.000

You do things our way.

00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:52.500
Do you need something?

00:25:53.583 --> 00:25:56.166
-You're the mukbang streamer, right?
-Yes.

00:25:57.416 --> 00:25:59.250
-What are you filming?
-What do you want?

00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:01.041
Smells good. Let me see.

00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:02.375
-Famous influencer.
-What?

00:26:02.458 --> 00:26:03.458
Is there a problem?

00:26:03.541 --> 00:26:04.916
I'll file a complaint.

00:26:05.458 --> 00:26:07.041
That looks delicious.

00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:08.708
Too bad I'm full.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.416
What a lunatic.

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:26.166
The delivery guy barged in.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.416
That's creepy.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.833
Unbelievable.
I'm gonna file a complaint later.

00:26:30.833 --> 00:26:31.958
Let's film first.

00:26:32.041 --> 00:26:32.875
Okay.

what we're going to cook is

00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:49.250
Budae Jjigae.

00:26:50.291 --> 00:26:54.666
I'm telling you, when the luncheon meat
soaks up the soup and you bite--

00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:57.458
What now?

00:27:53.333 --> 00:27:55.041

-Drink.

00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:57.333

I'm treating you guys to dinner.

00:28:11.416 --> 00:28:13.750
I can't. My wife's cooking.

00:28:17.666 --> 00:28:20.916
-How is Hsiao-hui lately?
-Not bad. She's fine.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.375
-She's fine?
-Yes.

00:28:22.458 --> 00:28:25.041
Why did she faint if she's fine?

00:28:34.916 --> 00:28:38.291

I also got Best Costume

-Okay.

00:30:13.208 --> 00:30:15.291
Take off your wings before you eat.

00:30:15.375 --> 00:30:16.791
I'll take them off after.

00:30:17.416 --> 00:30:18.250
Any more dishes?

00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:19.666
There's one more.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.625
It's coming.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.666
Here.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Here.

00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:28.250
Did you drink?

00:30:28.333 --> 00:30:29.250
What?

00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:31.000
A little bit.

00:30:31.083 --> 00:30:32.416
Did you smoke?

00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:34.750
A little bit, too.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:36.958
I told you to eat at home today,
yet you drank.

00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:39.791
That's why I drank and smoked,
but didn't eat.

00:30:40.958 --> 00:30:42.541
Mom, did you see a doctor?

00:30:43.166 --> 00:30:44.291
Why would she?

00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:46.666
Mom fainted yesterday.

00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:48.833
I'm fine.

00:30:48.916 --> 00:30:50.291
I just felt dizzy.

00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:52.958
You should still see a doctor.

00:30:53.833 --> 00:30:55.083
Just eat your food.

00:30:55.166 --> 00:30:58.333
You keep telling me to eat,
but you won't see a doctor.

00:30:58.416 --> 00:30:59.625
Let's play a game.

00:30:59.708 --> 00:31:01.708
If I win, Mom sees a doctor tomorrow,

00:31:01.791 --> 00:31:03.500
and Dad gives me his cigarettes.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.500
Let's eat first.

00:31:07.875 --> 00:31:10.083
Which one is the certificate
for first place?

00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:14.541
Why wear a mask when we're guessing?

00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:17.041
So the police can't see my face.

00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:18.166
Who said that?

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.500
Hurry up, which one?

00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:25.208
That one.

00:31:26.083 --> 00:31:27.000
No.

00:31:27.666 --> 00:31:29.083
-No?
-No.

00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:31.875
The one in the middle.

00:31:31.958 --> 00:31:32.958
No.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.500
-This one.
-No.

00:31:41.541 --> 00:31:42.625
This one.

00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.041
How did you know?

00:31:48.125 --> 00:31:51.833
You were looking around for the first two,
but you didn't for this one.

00:31:52.375 --> 00:31:53.875
So if I don't look, it's real?

00:31:53.958 --> 00:31:55.500
Hey, do you know who she is?

00:31:55.583 --> 00:31:56.833
She's my wife.

00:31:56.916 --> 00:31:58.375
A police officer's wife.

00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:01.625
Gosh, you're both cheating.

00:32:29.708 --> 00:32:33.875
DINNER IS BY THE DOOR, REMEMBER TO EAT IT

00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:52.083

The famous Officer Chen,

00:32:56.666 --> 00:32:59.083
-is now a famous killer.
-What're you talking about?

00:32:59.166 --> 00:33:00.958
Say a few words.

00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:03.750
-Put your phone down.
-Speak up. Too scared to talk?

00:33:03.833 --> 00:33:06.208
You can kill, but you can't talk?

00:33:08.291 --> 00:33:09.875
-Influencer?
-Isn't he that cop?

00:33:09.958 --> 00:33:11.166
Loser. You're all…

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.416
-Back off!
-A-Hua, are you okay?

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.750
-Get back!
-I'm fine.

00:33:14.833 --> 00:33:16.708
-Ambulance!
-Ambulance!

00:33:17.333 --> 00:33:18.625
Call 911!

00:33:19.541 --> 00:33:23.125
SHOOTING INCIDENT EVIL COP LOST CONTROL
AND SHOT FAMOUS INFLUENCER

00:33:23.708 --> 00:33:25.416
Get back! Stop filming!

00:33:25.958 --> 00:33:27.000
Stop filming.

00:33:27.583 --> 00:33:29.916
Isn't he the guy in the video?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.833
Thank you.

00:33:31.833 --> 00:33:33.041
Hey, sir.

00:33:33.125 --> 00:33:34.666
Sir, can I help you?

00:33:35.583 --> 00:33:38.250
I'm looking for the patient
who got shot yesterday.

00:33:38.333 --> 00:33:40.541
-He was transferred to another room.
-Where?

00:33:41.708 --> 00:33:43.625
Sorry, I can't disclose that.

00:33:47.166 --> 00:33:48.791
-You might…
-Looking for Mr. Wei?

00:33:49.625 --> 00:33:51.083
It's fine. I'll take him.

00:33:51.166 --> 00:33:52.000
Okay.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.833
You're trending.

00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:09.208
GOOD MORNING, SUNRISE AND HOPE

00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:10.791
STAY WARM, IT'S GETTING CHILLY

00:34:10.875 --> 00:34:11.750
REMEMBER TO EAT IT

00:34:11.833 --> 00:34:12.666
I'M WORKING

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.041
DINNER IS BY THE DOOR

00:34:16.458 --> 00:34:17.541
Your daughter?

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.208
-Sir.
-Go wash your face.

00:34:34.291 --> 00:34:36.250
-Okay. Please sign--
-Hurry up.

00:34:36.333 --> 00:34:37.208
Yes, sir.

00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:07.083
Hey, what happened?

00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:09.208
Sir, the patient has chest bleeding.

00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:11.375
Please wait outside. Excuse me.

00:35:16.833 --> 00:35:18.458
-Prepare to intubate.
-Okay.

00:35:20.083 --> 00:35:21.750
Doc, blood loss is over 1600cc.

00:35:21.833 --> 00:35:22.958
Emergency thoracotomy.

00:35:23.041 --> 00:35:24.083
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:35:34.166 --> 00:35:36.791
Doors closing. Elevator door closing.

00:35:40.916 --> 00:35:41.916
Dr. Kuo.

00:35:42.916 --> 00:35:45.458
How could this happen when you're here?

00:35:48.208 --> 00:35:49.208
What do you mean?

00:35:54.833 --> 00:35:55.958
Mr. Chen.

00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:59.208
If you hadn't shot him,
this wouldn't have happened.

00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:04.458
You mean a public servant?

00:36:04.541 --> 00:36:07.041
According to the internet,
you're the enemy.

00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.208
I'd quit if that scared me.

00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:11.541
Chen Chia-jen.

00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:13.833
Can't you see he came
to the police station

00:36:13.916 --> 00:36:15.083
to get shot on purpose?

00:36:15.791 --> 00:36:18.708
If you don't clear your name,
there'll be more trouble.

00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:33.875
YU-CHIEH

00:36:53.583 --> 00:36:55.458
Yes, I'm working overtime.

00:36:55.541 --> 00:36:57.875
We had an emergency
with a chest-bleed patient.

00:36:58.833 --> 00:37:00.541
Okay, sure.

00:37:00.625 --> 00:37:02.291
Okay, bye-bye.

00:37:04.541 --> 00:37:05.750
Freeze!

00:37:05.833 --> 00:37:06.791
-It's fine.
-Freeze!

00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:08.125
Call 911!

00:37:09.375 --> 00:37:10.333
Get back.

00:37:11.375 --> 00:37:12.583
Officer Chen Chia-jen.

00:37:12.666 --> 00:37:14.625
-Dox him.
-Chen Chia-jen.

00:37:14.708 --> 00:37:16.666
-Chen Chia-jen.
-A Cop shot an influencer.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.166
Who is Chen Chia-jen?

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:19.208
Dox him.

00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:21.250
-He went too far.
-For views.

00:37:21.333 --> 00:37:23.291
But must he shoot him in the chest?

00:37:25.416 --> 00:37:27.125
Chen Chia-jen, First Precinct.

00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:29.083
-Chen Chia-jen.
-Chen Chia-jen.

00:37:29.166 --> 00:37:32.208
-He failed school and ended up a cop.
-Loser Chen Chia-jen.

00:37:33.166 --> 00:37:36.208
-So what if he's a public servant?
-Killer cop.

00:37:40.208 --> 00:37:41.541
I'm Ting-yu.

00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:43.333
My best friend, Wei Yen,

00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:45.791
was almost killed by a cop.

00:37:45.875 --> 00:37:49.208
I'm standing right where Wei Yen was shot.

00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:50.708
Look over here.

00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:53.500
This is where Chen Chia-jen
fired the shot.

00:37:53.583 --> 00:37:54.958
He was this close.

00:37:55.041 --> 00:37:57.625
He dared to shoot Wei Yen from this close.

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:58.833
Hey.

00:37:58.916 --> 00:38:00.875
What are you looking at?

00:38:00.958 --> 00:38:02.625
Witch Baba uploaded a new video.

00:38:04.083 --> 00:38:05.291
Witch Baba?

00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:07.041
WITCH BABA

00:38:10.541 --> 00:38:15.333
LI HSIN-PING
SIR, WITCH BABA HAS A NEW PREDICTION.

00:38:21.041 --> 00:38:25.083
WITCH BABA

00:38:25.166 --> 00:38:28.166
WITCH BABA
THE FRIEND BABA LOVES THE MOST

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.875
Hello, everyone. I'm Witch Baba.

00:38:31.958 --> 00:38:34.208
Today is October 2nd.

00:38:34.291 --> 00:38:36.666
My last prediction about the shooting

00:38:37.416 --> 00:38:39.708
actually happened, right?

00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:44.458
The injured person is still
in critical condition at the hospital.

00:38:44.541 --> 00:38:47.833
Let's keep him
in our thoughts and prayers.

00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:52.083
So… let's draw the next cards.

00:38:53.125 --> 00:38:54.750
I wonder what message

00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:56.791
the cards have for us.

00:38:56.875 --> 00:38:58.333
First card.

00:38:59.166 --> 00:39:00.708
Second card.

00:39:01.375 --> 00:39:03.083
Third card.

00:39:05.166 --> 00:39:06.458
Hollywood upright.

00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:09.958
Pope reversed.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.958
The Pentagon reversed.

00:39:27.125 --> 00:39:29.541
Hollywood upright.

00:39:30.583 --> 00:39:32.458
Pope reversed.

00:39:33.916 --> 00:39:35.916
The Pentagon reversed.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.333
In the future…

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.958
someone will die from drowning.

00:39:44.375 --> 00:39:46.333
I'm sorry.

00:44:46.708 --> 00:44:51.708
