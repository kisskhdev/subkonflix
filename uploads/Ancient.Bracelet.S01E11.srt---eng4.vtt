Zhaoli,

you came on to me first this time.

(The Fire Phoenix.)

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.070
(Wu Zhaoli is the Saintess.)

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.790
What was meant to happen

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.590
has happened at last.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.680
Your wounds have healed.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.310
Does it still hurt?

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.590
No, it doesn't.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.080
My whole body

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.560
just feels a bit sore.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.640
Zhaoli,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.240
do you truly have feelings

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.800
for Ying Du?

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.470
My heart

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.630
indeed leans toward him.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.400
But Zhaoli,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.080
you two can never truly be together.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.270
Grandmother,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.630
what do you mean by that?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.080
Zhaoli,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.000
it's time you learned
the truth of your birth.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.080
You were never an orphan.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.680
Your mother was Goddess Xingyue.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.630
She fell into a love tribulation

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.240
and was punished by fate,
with her soul scattered.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.240
And your power

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.430
was sealed at birth.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.800
Now, your power has awakened,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.240
and you've become the Saintess.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.750
Grandmother,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.520
even if I am the Saintess,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.150
why can't I be with Ying Du?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.680
They say the Saintess is bound by fate,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.960
unable to feel love,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.800
or she'll face punishment.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.870
You two are trapped

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.470
in a cycle of grudges and tangled fate.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.680
You're destined

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.800
to meet as enemies, bound by hate.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.470
Grandmother,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.190
it's only a legend.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.560
No matter what my identity is,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.590
my bond with Ying Du

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.240
will never change.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.240
Let's check out the shop up ahead.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.640
Alright.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.640
Let's go.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.480
(Oracle, Teahouse)

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.070
(Why is Oracle not here?)

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.010
Why is it raining again?

00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:27.790
Who knows?

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.230
Zhaoli.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.440
Let's go home.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.470
Hurry up.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.270
It's not too late for you to know

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.480
the grudge with Ying Du.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.510
Che, you...

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.570
I can use the Bracelet too.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.056
If you wish to see your past
and present with Ying Du,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.720
I can help you.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.070
You caused the fall of my entire tribe.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.030
Zhaoli.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.390
In your past life, Ying Du killed

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:09.613
all your dear family and kin

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.390
without exception.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.240
Not only that,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.310
you'll one day turn blades
on each other.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.560
But I have no memories

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.240
of the dearest ones

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.310
you speak of.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.630
I don't even know them.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.386
What about your grandmother?

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.176
In the foretelling dream I had,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.950
Ying Du would kill her as well.

00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:33.272
If that's the punishment

00:05:33.283 --> 00:05:34.276
the Saintess will face...

00:05:34.287 --> 00:05:35.070
Enough, Che.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.440
Stop trying to sow discord

00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:37.680
between Ying Du and me.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.360
I don't believe any of this.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.000
Right now,

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.000
I truly and deeply love him,

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.120
and he has me in his heart too.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:47.870
That is enough.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.800
As for the punishment you speak of,

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.000
I will face it together with him.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.240
You need not worry about it.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.880
(Zhaoli,)

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.500
(I've failed time and again)

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.360
(to kill Ying Du because of you.)

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.800
(This time,)

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.190
(I'll use your hand)

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.240
(to rid him once and for all.)

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.800
Help! Help me!

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.960
Please spare me.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.000
(Something's wrong.)

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.840
Spare me.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.270
Please spare me.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.070
Grandmother.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.270
Grandmother!

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.440
Grandmother!

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.030
Help me.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.590
Wu Luoluo.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.640
Help me.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.560
Wu Luoluo,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.430
what on earth is happening?

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.480
Ying Du has lost his mind.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.800
He wants to destroy us all.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.000
Ying Du?

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.520
That's impossible.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.480
No, it can't be true.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.830
It's real,

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.000
terribly real.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.910
Wu Luoluo... Wu Luoluo!

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.000
Grandmother!

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.560
Don't!

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.560
Zhaoli,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.630
go...

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.080
Grandmother,

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.800
wake up!

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.360
It's me, Zhaoli!

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.950
Why...

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.830
Why?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.960
Ying Du,

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.800
it really was you.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560
Why?

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.510
Why would you do this?
